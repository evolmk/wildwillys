                .question Is Tipping Appropriate?
                .answer The dealers at your casino party are service people just like waiters, photographers, djâ€™s and bartenders. They provide a service for you just as they would in an actual casino and tipping is generally based on the level of that service. Unlike an actual casino, the chips have no cash value and therefore players cannot use them to tip dealers. It becomes the responsibility of the host, just as at a large dinner party at a restaurant, to tip the dealers. It is common place for guests to tip based on their level of enjoyment at the table. Our Dealers will at no time ask or solicite tips, as it is unprofessional to do so.

                .question How does a typical event go?
                .answer We give you the "funny money" that comes in fake $ bills. You hand that out to your guests who in turn "cash in" for chips at the gaming tables with it. At the end of the night guests simply turn the chips back in to the dealer, or "bank", for raffle tickets or for winning totals. For Fundraisers a bank is usually setup for guests to donate money for additional chips.
